Static webpages and websites are having a great comeback because of new tools to build them and new services to host them. I will introduce some of them here.

<!-- end -->

I smiled when I read the first chapter of a [blogpost](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-reasons-use-static-site-generator/) with the headline _What is a Static Site?_ I bet 20 years ago somewhere was a blogpost with the introduction question _What is a Dynamic Site?_. Sometimes we forget how it all started.

Like me maybe you have already heard of netlify, JAMStack, Gatsby, next.js or nuxt.js but could not really bring it into context with server side rendering and static site generators. I will try to bring these in order here.

# Static vs Dynamic Webpages

A webpage is static if it is served directly as an HTML file from a webserver. The webserver does nothing more than grabbing the HTML file from the harddrive and sends it to the client.

A dynamic webpage is written in a programming language and processed by a web (applicaton) server to generate the HTML which is then sent to the client. This process is called [Server-Side Rendering](#ssr).

On stackoverflow I stumbled over the question, [if a static website may consist of JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44458712/can-a-static-website-consist-of-javascript). Since the huge possibilities developers have with modern JavaScript, this question cannot be answererd easy any more. The usage of JavaScript on a webpage can vary between just enhancing the user experience a bit and creating a whole application via DOM manipulation like Single Page Applications (SPA) do.

In the first case the webpage can still be considered static, while the pages of a SPA generated by [Client-Side Rendering](#csr) should be considered dynamic.

# <a name="csr"></a>Client-Side Rendering

This should better be called Client-Side _DOM Manipulation_. SPA's built with Frameworks like React, Angular or Vue deliver only an index.html with a reference to the JavaScript application file. The webpages are then rendered via direct DOM manipulation through JavaScript on the client.

> SPAs manipulate the DOM directly via JavaScript. They use only one almost empty HTML file or [an application shell](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell) as an anchor. Thus the name **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplications.

# <a name="ssr"></a>Server-Side Rendering

A web server compiles HTML on-the-fly when a client asks for a specific page. Technologies like Microsoft's Active Server Page (ASP) already worked like that in the 90s. Today with node based backends like express.js the JavaScript based DOM manipulation of SPAs can be done on the server and the result is then sent to the client.

Frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for React application and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) (obviously inspired by Next.js) for Vue.js applications enable Server-Side Rendering for their underlying SPA frameworks.

# Dynamic Rendering

JavaScript based dynamic webpages can be problematic from a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) perspective, since not all webcrawlers will execute JavaScript properly and may therefore index only the not very meaningful application shell.

> Although Googlebot is said to be able to render JavaScript since 2014, static webpages currently may still have an advantage concerning SEO. This may change with the development of more sophisticated webcrawlers.

In 2018 Google announced the concept of [Dynamic Rendering](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering#implement). In short this means that dependent from the User Agent the web server delivers different versions of the website. A web crawler may get a server-side rendered or prerendered version, while a webbrowser will get the JavaScript heavy version for Client-Side Rendering.

> Dynamic Rendering does not count as [Cloaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking), but it is still not allowed to add additional Keywords or Links to the webcrawler version of the page.

# Prerendering `(Work in progress)`

Prerendering generates static HTML files at build time. Tools which support this process are known as [Static Site Generators (SSG)](https://www.keycdn.com/support/static-site-generator). Because of the sites are prerendered during the build process, all content must therefore be available at build time.

Static Site Generators exist since several years. They often are specialised for different kinds of websites, like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (2008) for blogs, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (2013) for websites or [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) (2014) for documentation.

While Jekyll for example is written in Ruby, there are new tools emerging which are based on modern SPA Frameworks. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for example is a very popular Static Site Generator based on React. The previously introduced Server-Side Rendering framework Next.js can also be used as a SSG since it has three different export modes, one of them being Static HTML.

# The JAM Stack `(Work in progress)`

> How do modern Static sites handle dynamic content like API-Requests and User input? Entrance: The JAM Stack => Dynamic

The trend of static websites is accompanied by a stack acronym: JAM. This may become the third very important stack after LAMP (1998) and MEAN (2013). In the [JAM](https://jamstack.org/)-Stack (ca. 2016) (client-side **J**avaScript, reusable **A**PIs, **m**arkup) the dynamic content ist provided by external services.

The inventors of JAM. Support the hosting of your JAM-Stack based application very good.

> Those Service Provider are of Netlify of course, but also [Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/)?

# Why? My two cent... `(Work in progress)`

One reason is of course the performance and better security of static websites about which has already been sufficiently written about. But another reason is the possibility to include the content providing non technical savy user.

With version control and CI/CD Pipelines Software developers have sophisticated tools and processes for code maintenance and deployments. These tools were not used by non technical savy people who had to use Content Mangement Systems like Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal or TYPO3 to provide their content.

With easy to use tools and cloud based version control and CI/CD pipelines these users can now benefit from the same processes.

## Git based CMS System `(Work in progress)`

Here is an example stack for a new kind of CMS System:

-   [DevBlog](https://ryanfitzgerald.github.io/devblog/) is a blog template based on GatsbyJS. Create your own branch in GitHub.
-   The application can then be hosted at netlify. Commits to the master branch will automatically deploy the site.
-   Content providing users can create new blogposts via [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/). They need their own github account and can deploy new markdown files as blogposts to githubb
    -   You can let the users push directly to master branch, or
    -   you can of course use same rules as usual like no pushes to master branch without pull requests.

## Headless CMS System `(Work in progress)`

Netlify CMS is a so called headless CMS System.

> How does it compare to git based CMS System above?
